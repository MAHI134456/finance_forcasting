**Tesla focus:** Given TSLA’s high-growth profile, elevated volatility is expected. Rolling standard deviation spikes often align with major news or earnings; use volatility-aware position sizing and consider scenario analysis around catalysts.


## Rolling Behavior (Short-Term Trends)
- We computed a **20-day rolling mean** of price and **20-day rolling standard deviation** of returns.
- Rising rolling mean with falling rolling std usually indicates **steady uptrends**; spikes in rolling std indicate **volatility shocks**.

- Sharpe uses a constant annual risk-free rate of 2.00%; adjust if needed.  
- Past performance does not guarantee future results.
